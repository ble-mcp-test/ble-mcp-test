# CS108 BLE Simulator Ideas

## Background

During development of ble-mcp-test, we identified that using a real CS108 RFID reader ($600+) for testing creates a barrier to entry for contributors. We discussed creating accessible alternatives for testing.

## Approach 1: nRF52 Hardware Emulator

Create firmware for nRF52 dev boards ($40) that mimics CS108 BLE protocol:
- Advertises as "CS108ReaderXXXXXX"
- Implements service 0x9800 with characteristics 0x9900 (write) and 0x9901 (notify)
- Responds to basic commands like GET_BATTERY_VOLTAGE (0xA000)
- Arduino/C++ based for accessibility

Benefits:
- Real hardware testing
- Accessible price point
- Educational for BLE peripheral development

## Approach 2: TypeScript Software Simulator

Since a CS108 simulator already exists in TypeScript (from the web worker state machine project), we could:

### Option A: Node.js BLE Peripheral
Use Noble.js/bleno in peripheral mode to create a virtual CS108:
```typescript
// Use existing TypeScript CS108 simulator
// Broadcast as real BLE peripheral using bleno
// No hardware required
// Perfect for CI/CD testing
```

### Option B: Direct WebSocket Simulator
Create a WebSocket server that mimics CS108 responses:
```typescript
// CS108 simulator speaks WebSocket directly
// Bypasses BLE entirely for pure software testing
// Could connect directly to ble-mcp-test
```

## Benefits for CSL

CSL (the CS108 manufacturer) would likely appreciate:
1. **Lower barrier to entry** - Developers can experiment without hardware investment
2. **Protocol documentation** - Simulator serves as living documentation
3. **Increased adoption** - More developers can build CS108 integrations
4. **Testing infrastructure** - Automated testing without physical devices

## Integration with Web Worker Project

The existing TypeScript CS108 simulator from the web worker state machine project could be:
1. Extended to support full command set
2. Wrapped with BLE peripheral interface (bleno)
3. Used for both development and automated testing
4. Bridge between ble-mcp-test and web worker architecture

This creates a complete testing ecosystem:
- Web app → ble-mcp-test → virtual CS108 (simulator)
- All in TypeScript/JavaScript
- No hardware required for development
- Real hardware path available when needed

## Next Steps

1. Evaluate bleno compatibility with current Node.js/OS versions
2. Extract CS108 protocol into shared library
3. Create examples for both hardware and software simulation
4. Reach out to CSL about official simulator support
