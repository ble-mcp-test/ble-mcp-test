# v0.9.0 BLE Device Farm Specification

## Executive Summary
Transform ble-mcp-test from a single-device bridge into an enterprise-scale device farm that can manage pools of BLE devices for parallel testing, CI/CD pipelines, and multi-user development teams.

## Problem Statement
Current limitations in BLE testing at scale:
- Single device = testing bottleneck
- "Device is busy" errors block development
- No way to run parallel CI/CD tests
- Manual device management doesn't scale
- Device failures halt entire test suites

## Solution: BLE Device Farm

### Core Features

#### 1. Device Pool Discovery
```javascript
// Automatic discovery of all devices with target service
const pool = await DeviceFarm.discover({
  serviceUuid: '9800',
  maxDevices: 20,
  timeout: 30000
});
// Returns: ["CS108-001", "CS108-002", ..., "CS108-020"]
```

#### 2. Intelligent Load Balancing
- Round-robin for even wear
- Least-recently-used for battery optimization  
- Health-weighted selection
- Affinity groups for specific test requirements

#### 3. Connection Request API
```javascript
// Test requests any available device
const device = await navigator.bluetooth.requestDevice({
  filters: [{ services: ['9800'] }]
});
// Farm automatically assigns CS108-007 (least used)
```

#### 4. Queue Management
When all devices busy:
- Requests queued with fair scheduling
- Priority levels for CI/CD vs development
- Timeout and retry policies
- Real-time queue position updates

#### 5. Health Monitoring
- Heartbeat checks every 30s
- Battery level tracking
- Connection success rate
- Automatic device removal on failure
- Self-healing with device reset

#### 6. Multi-Node Architecture
- Distribute devices across multiple machines
- Centralized coordination service
- Fault tolerance - node failures don't affect others
- Geographic distribution for global teams

### Implementation Phases

#### Phase 1: Single-Node Pool (2 weeks)
- Device enumeration and registration
- Basic round-robin assignment
- Simple busy/available tracking

#### Phase 2: Health & Recovery (1 week)
- Device health checks
- Automatic recovery procedures
- Battery monitoring and alerts

#### Phase 3: Advanced Scheduling (2 weeks)
- Queue management system
- Priority scheduling
- Load balancing algorithms

#### Phase 4: Multi-Node Support (2 weeks)
- Distributed architecture
- Node coordination protocol
- Failover handling

### Configuration Example
```yaml
# device-farm.yml
farm:
  name: "TrakRF CS108 Pool"
  service_uuid: "9800"
  
nodes:
  - host: "rack1.local"
    devices: 10
  - host: "rack2.local"  
    devices: 10
    
policies:
  max_test_duration: 300s
  idle_timeout: 60s
  priority_queues:
    - name: "ci-cd"
      priority: 100
    - name: "development"
      priority: 50
      
health:
  check_interval: 30s
  min_battery: 20%
  max_failures: 3
```

### Use Case Examples

#### CI/CD Pipeline
```yaml
# .github/workflows/test.yml
jobs:
  test:
    strategy:
      matrix:
        device: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - run: npm test
        env:
          BLE_FARM_URL: wss://farm.company.com
          BLE_FARM_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.BLE_FARM_TOKEN }}
```
10 parallel test suites, each gets own device, 10x faster testing!

#### Developer Workflow
```javascript
// Developers just code - farm handles device allocation
const device = await navigator.bluetooth.requestDevice({
  filters: [{ services: ['9800'] }]
});
// Automatically gets next available device
// If all busy, queued with real-time updates
```

#### 24/7 Stress Testing
```javascript
// Rotate through devices to prevent overheating
const farm = new DeviceFarm({ rotationInterval: '1h' });
await farm.runStressTest({
  duration: '7d',
  operations: 1000000
});
```

### Enterprise Features

#### Access Control
- Teams get dedicated device quotas
- RBAC for device pool management
- Usage analytics and reporting

#### Monitoring Dashboard
- Real-time device status
- Queue depth and wait times
- Historical usage patterns
- Battery health trends

#### API Integration
```javascript
// REST API for farm management
GET /api/v1/farm/status
GET /api/v1/farm/devices
POST /api/v1/farm/reserve
DELETE /api/v1/farm/release/{deviceId}
```

### Migration Path
1. v0.5.x users continue with single device
2. v0.9.0 auto-detects multiple devices
3. Graceful upgrade - works with 1 or 100 devices
4. Zero config for basic pooling

### Business Value
- **10x faster CI/CD** - parallel test execution
- **Zero developer blocking** - queue instead of fail
- **Hardware ROI** - better device utilization
- **Enterprise ready** - scale from 1 to 1000 devices
- **SLA compliance** - health monitoring and failover

### Competitive Advantage
No other BLE testing solution offers:
- Automatic device pooling
- Service UUID-based routing
- Multi-node coordination
- Enterprise queue management
- Self-healing capabilities

This positions ble-mcp-test as THE solution for enterprise BLE testing infrastructure.
