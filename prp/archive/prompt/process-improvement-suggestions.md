# PRP Process Improvement Suggestions

Based on the bytestream logging feature implementation, several gaps were identified in the PRP generation process where requirements from the spec were not carried forward to the prompt.

## Issues Identified

### 1. Missing Project Management Tasks
The following requirements were present in `prp/spec/add-bytestream-logging.md` but completely absent from `prp/prompt/add-bytestream-logging.md`:
- Version bump to 0.2.0 (spec line 10)
- README.md documentation updates (spec line 11)
- CHANGELOG.md creation (spec line 12)

### 2. Selective Requirement Extraction
The PRP generation tool successfully captured complex technical requirements but dropped simpler, explicit project housekeeping tasks. This suggests the tool may be:
- Prioritizing technical implementation details over project management tasks
- Not treating all requirements with equal importance
- Missing explicit action items that aren't deeply technical

### 3. Lost Documentation Requirements
Documentation updates (README, CHANGELOG) were clearly stated in the spec but didn't make it to the prompt, indicating these may be filtered out or deprioritized during generation.

## Recommended Improvements

### 1. Explicit Requirements Checklist
Add a dedicated section in prompts that explicitly lists ALL requirements from the spec, including:
- Version changes
- Documentation updates
- File additions/deletions
- Configuration changes
- Test requirements

### 2. Project Management Task Recognition
Enhance the PRP tool to recognize and preserve project management patterns:
- Version bump instructions (e.g., "bump version to X.Y.Z")
- Documentation directives (e.g., "update README with...")
- Changelog requirements (e.g., "add CHANGELOG entry for...")
- Release preparation tasks

### 3. Requirement Validation
Implement a validation step that ensures all action items from the spec appear in the prompt:
- Parse spec for imperative statements ("add", "update", "create", "bump")
- Verify each action item appears in the generated prompt
- Flag any missing requirements for manual review

### 4. Success Criteria Alignment
The prompt's "Success Criteria" section should include ALL measurable outcomes from the spec, not just technical ones:
- [ ] Version bumped to specified version
- [ ] Documentation updated with new features
- [ ] CHANGELOG entry added
- [ ] All technical requirements met

### 5. Equal Priority Treatment
Don't deprioritize "simple" tasks - they're often critical for proper release management:
- Treat version bumps as first-class requirements
- Include documentation updates in main task list
- Consider project housekeeping as essential as code changes

## Example Enhancement

The prompt should have included a section like:
```yaml
Project Management Tasks:
  - Bump package.json version to 0.2.0
  - Create CHANGELOG.md with 0.2.0 release notes
  - Update README.md with LOG_LEVEL environment variable documentation
  - Follow changelog best practices from https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/
```

## Conclusion

The PRP generation tool excels at extracting complex technical requirements but needs improvement in preserving ALL requirements equally, especially project management and documentation tasks that are critical for proper software releases.
