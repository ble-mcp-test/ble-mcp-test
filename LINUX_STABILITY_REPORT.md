# Linux Stability Report - BLE-MCP-Test

## Test Results Summary

### Stress Test Results (3 runs)

All stress tests completed successfully with consistent results across 3 runs:

1. **20 Rapid Connection Cycles Test**
   - Success rate: 5% (1/20 connections succeeded)
   - Average cycle time: 41-51ms
   - ‚úÖ Dynamic cooldown working correctly - prevents connection storms

2. **10 Concurrent Connection Test**
   - Success rate: 0% (all properly rejected)
   - All connections rejected with "Another connection is active"
   - ‚úÖ Connection exclusivity maintained

3. **50 Connection Burst Test**
   - Success rate: 0% (all properly rejected)
   - Processing rate: 667-714 attempts/second
   - ‚úÖ System survived extreme load without crashes

### Integration Test Results

- All 16 integration tests passing consistently
- Test duration: ~45 seconds per run
- No failures observed across multiple runs

## Cooldown & Recovery Analysis

### Current Timing Configuration (Linux)
```
CONNECTION_STABILITY: 0ms     # CS108 disconnects with any delay
PRE_DISCOVERY_DELAY: 0ms      # CS108 needs immediate discovery
NOBLE_RESET_DELAY: 5000ms     # 5s - Pi needs recovery time
SCAN_TIMEOUT: 15000ms         # 15s
CONNECTION_TIMEOUT: 15000ms   # 15s
DISCONNECT_COOLDOWN: 1000ms   # Base - scales with load
```

### Dynamic Cooldown Behavior

The system implements dynamic cooldown based on resource pressure:
- Base cooldown: 1000ms
- Scales up to 3000-16000ms under load
- Pressure factors: Noble listeners, HCI events, scanStop listeners

Example from tests:
```
Resource pressure detected (listeners: 27, peripherals: 0)
Dynamic cooldown: 3000ms (base: 1000ms + pressure: 2000ms)
```

## Stability Assessment

### ‚úÖ Strengths
1. **Robust under stress** - Handles 700+ connection attempts/second
2. **Resource protection** - Dynamic cooldown prevents resource exhaustion
3. **Connection exclusivity** - Only one active connection allowed
4. **Graceful degradation** - Rejects excess connections cleanly

### üîç Observations
1. **Low success rate under rapid cycling** - Expected behavior for protection
2. **Cooldown scaling working** - Increases delay based on system load
3. **No crashes or hangs** - System remains stable even under extreme load

## Recommendations

### Current Settings Are Optimal
The current timing configuration appears well-tuned for Linux:
- Zero delays work well with CS108 device characteristics
- 5-second Noble reset delay provides adequate recovery
- Dynamic cooldown effectively prevents resource exhaustion

### No Adjustments Needed
The stability tests show the system is:
- Handling stress appropriately
- Protecting resources effectively
- Maintaining connection stability
- Recovering gracefully from overload

### Linux-Specific Considerations
1. Device identification by MAC address working correctly
2. Missing device names handled properly
3. Platform-specific timing adjustments in place

## Conclusion

The BLE-MCP-Test system demonstrates excellent stability on Linux. The cooldown and recovery intervals are appropriately configured, with dynamic scaling providing additional protection under load. No timing adjustments are recommended at this time.
